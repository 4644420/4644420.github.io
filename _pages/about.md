Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory, which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
